# Spatial-Ecology-and-Macroecology 2024

*Petr Keil, Florencia Grattarola, Friederike WÃ¶lke, Carmen Soria, Gabriele Midolo, Gabriel Ortega*

## Summary

This is an introduction to geographical patterns of species distributions and biodiversity, and their connections to applied ecological and conservation problems. It focuses on biological phenomena at large geographic resolutions (ca. 1km2 or coarser) or large geographic extents (continents, Earth). It also introduces major theories and models that explain or predict these geographic patterns. Practical parts are done mostly in R, and they aim to introduce data types, and quantitative methods used in macroecology. The course blends elements of biogeography, ecology, and spatial data analysis. Among others, the course is aimed at species distribution modellers, physical geographers, conservationists, and policy makers who will benefit from a "big picture" perspective not provided by traditional ecology, nor by physical geography.

## Requirements

Elementary knowledge of R, i.e. participants should be able to turn it on, load data in, and execute basic commands. Prior knowledge of ecology, geography, or statistics is advantageous, but not necessary.

## Exam

Will be in person, it will last between 30-60 minutes, and it will be mostly about the contents of the lectures. Petr will offer dates throughout the examination period.

## Zapocet

"Zapocet" is given based on your attendance in the practical class (up to 3 absences are tolerated), and you need to either **give a 5-10 min presentation** (on 12.12.2022) or hand in a **2-3 page report**.

Both formats need to contain:

- Introduction of the system (taxon, region, variables) that 
you analyzed
- Description of your objectives (e.g. to map the species, to estimate its 
climatic requirements, to map species richness, etc.)
- Brief description of the methods that you will use
- Results (effect sizes, variable importance, predicted maps)
- Brief discussion of what the results mean
- We may ask you for your code

If the presentation or the report need a clear improvement, we may ask you to fix
it before giving you the zapocet.

If you're doing the written report, ideally send it to Petr at least **one week before
the oral exam** to give us some time to fix issues.

- 18. Nov - **Evolution of biodiversity.** Global biodiversity in geological time, mass extinctions, speciation and evolution - from natural selection to emergence of new species. Types of speciation, diversification, radiation, phylogeny. The current global biodiversity, and its partition among plants, animals, bacteria, primary productents, and among realms. 

- 25. Nov - **Mechanistic and simulation models** The idea of complex nature emerging from simple rules. Cellular automata - Conway's game of life, rule 30, fractals, deterministic chaos. Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity (UNTB) - how it sits in the context of competitive exclusion principle, niche theory, and paradox of the plankton. How UNTB works.

- 2. Dec - **Spatial patterns of biodiversity - where are the places with many species?** Biodiversity patterns: Latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, their ubiquity and most common forms, and exceptions from the pattern. Explanations for the patterns: Rohde's hypothesis, metabolic theory, species-energy, endotherms vs ectotherms, habitat heterogeneity. Historical drivers of diversity. 

- 9. Dec - **Species composition, species associations** Community matrices and similarity matrices as the basis of community analysis. Pairwise similarity metrics, an example (Jaccard index), distance decay of similarity (Tobler's law), partitioning similarity to fractions explained by space vs environment, ordinations and clusters, biological regionalization. Interspecific associations, co-occurrences, inferring assembly rules from co-occurrence patterns.

- 16. Dec - **Temporal change - how does nature change in time during anthropocene?** Biodiversity change, species loss, extinction rates, invasions, homogenization, temporal turnover, temporal change of spatial turnover. Spatial scale and biodiversity change, drivers of biodiversity change, anthropocene. Conservation biogeography and applied issues.


## Practical classes  (Mon 12:15-13:45, computer room Z225)

Most practical classes use R. Mild use of either QGIS or ArcGIS can be expected.

- 30. Sep (**Flo**). Major biodiversity data sources and data types: GBIF, OBIS, Map of Life, IUCN, BIEN, eBIRD, BBS, important atlas projects. Temporal change databases: BioTime, PREDICTS. Open vs. closed data, data quality issues, download through R, licensing and data sharing.

- 7. Oct (**Flo**). An example of large-scale biodiversity database, learning the basics and visualizing things. Gridding biodiversity data (geographic ranges, biodiversity), exploring patterns at different resolutions, making pretty maps. 

- 14. Oct (**Flo**) - Drivers of distributions and diversity: Environmental data, historical data, human-related predictors, climate, soils, land cover. Future climate projected layers. Plotting and exploring associations and correlations.

- 21. Oct (**Carmen, Gabriele**). Species Distribution Models I.

- 28. Oct (**NO CLASS - STATE HOLIDAY**). 

- 4. Nov (**Gabriele, Carmen**). Species Distribution Models II.

- 11. Nov (**Petr**). Replacement for the missed lecture.

- 18. Nov (**Frieda**). Simulation models of biodiversity and evolution - we will play with a cellular automaton (rule 30, Game of Life). The goal is to exercise a bit of algorithmic thinking and do something fun, different from previous stuff, and with a graphic output.

- 25. Nov (**all**). Mini project I: Choosing a taxon, region, question, and data source. 

- 2. Dec (**Petr, Gabriele**). Mini project II. Work on the project with us, data preparation.
