## Practices  (Mon 12:15-13:45, computer room Z120)

### Week 1 - 26 September (**Flo**). Biodiversity data.
Data inputs:
  - All data were accessed and downloaded through `rgbif()`.  

### Week 2 - 3 October (**Flo**). Gridding and plotting biodiversity data.
Data inputs:
  - Administrative borders of the Czech Republic (shapefile): [CZE_adm0.shp](Practical_classes/Week2_gridding_and plotting/data).  
  - Grid of the Czech Republic (shapefile): [KvadratyCR_JTSK.shp](Practical_classes/Week2_gridding_and plotting/data).    
  - IUCN range maps of the *Testudines* of the world (shapefile): [data_0.shp](Practical_classes/Week2_gridding_and plotting/data/testudines).

Data outputs:
  - Cleaned GBIF records of the Mammals of the Czech Republic (rds): [mammalsCZ.rds](Practical_classes/Week2_gridding_and plotting/data/mammalsCZ.rds). 
  - Grid of the world, hexagons of 1 degree size (rds): [world_grid.rds](Practical_classes/Week2_gridding_and plotting/data/world_grid.rds).    
  - Grid of species richness of the *Testudines* of the world (rds): [testudines_grid.rds](Practical_classes/Week2_gridding_and plotting/data/testudines_grid.rds).      

### Week 3 - 10 October (**Flo**). Drivers.
Data inputs:
  - Worldclim Annual mean temperature (raster): [wc2.1_30s_bio_1.tif](/Practical_classes/Week3_predictors/data).  
  - Worldclim Precipitation seasonality (raster): [wc2.1_30s_bio_15.tif](/Practical_classes/Week3_predictors/data).  
  - Worldclim Elevation (raster): [wc2.1_30s_elev.tif](/Practical_classes/Week3_predictors/data).    
  - MODIS Terra Land-cover (raster): [MCD12Q1.006_LC_Prop1_doy2020001_aid0001.tif](/Practical_classes/Week3_predictors/data).     
  - SEDAC Human Footprint Index (raster): [wildareas-v3-2009-human-footprint.tif](/Practical_classes/Week3_predictors/data/wildareas-v3-2009-human-footprint-geotiff).  
  
Data outputs:
  - Administrative borders of Asia (shapefile): [Asia.shp](/Week3_gridding_and plotting/data/).  
  - Asian continent  (shapefile): [Asia_union.shp](/Week3_gridding_and plotting/data/).

### Week 4 - 17 October (**Petr**). Species Distribution Models (SDM) in R. Principle, techniques, fitting models, predicted vs observed maps, interpretation, predicting & forecasting.
### Week 5 - 24 October (**Francois**, Flo). Modelling patterns of biodiversity.
### Week 6 - 31 October (**Francois**). Biodiversity change.
### Week 7 - 7 November (**Francois**?). Species composition and beta diversity.
### Week 8 - 14 November (**Petr**). Simulation models of biodiversity - we will play with a simple neutral model, cellular automaton, etc.
### Week 9 - 21 November (**all**). Mini project I: Choosing a taxon, region, question, and data source. 
### Week 10 - 28 November (**all**). Mini project II.
### Week 11 - 5 December (**all**). Mini project III.
